{"name":"Moncton Beats","tagline":"Developing a Community-Based Publication","body":"# Moncton Beats: Collaborative, Transparent, Community Driven\r\nMoncton Beats, first of all, starts with individuals. We do not start with abstract concepts, but with the people who created them. Understanding the people who make a system is critical to feeling you can become part of it. It's the opposite of trying to navigate government departments that have become so vast and convoluted even the people who run them don't really understand them.\r\n\r\nSecond, we are out to solve problems, or rather help gather information that can help people solve problems. As journalists we adhere to certain methods and standards, but we believe we can effect change not as a biproduct of what we do, but as a central principle.\r\n\r\nThird, collaboration will be a key part of our process, collaboration and trancparency. Collaboration is just practical. Many of our journalists will not be experts in their beats (fields) and many will not even start out as journalists. Having experts and partners joining in on the project will increase the accuracy of anything we publish and increase our readers' trust in our work.  \r\n\r\nTransparency is also practical. While making you feel exposed initially, transparency lets others see what you're doing. It lets more experienced people mentor you and less experienced people learn from you. Plus it lets concerned people throw in their two cents.\r\n\r\nThis is why we're using GitHub, a version control system that many software developers have been using for years to work on opensource projects. GitHub, based on the more geeky Git system, lets others see exacty what you are doing and how you got there by making it possible to view every change, addition and delete you've made. Imagine if government laws and budgets used publicly available GitHub repositories. \r\n\r\nCreating complex products employing large, far flung groups is a tricky business, but GitHub (there are other user interfaces for Git) has been successful in helping people get their ideas into the system in the most efficent way. While Git/GitHub and have been used mostly by software developers, we believe it, or something like it, could be the next massively mainstream SMS or text messaging tool but for information processing of all kinds. SMS or texting also started out as a tool for techies.\r\n\r\n \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
