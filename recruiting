We're looking for people who want to paragraph, photograph, videograph or audiograph. You don't have to be professional. In fact, we prefer you weren't. Email us for a meeting if any the following describes you. 

You're unemployed or underemployed and ready and want to do something in community media different enough that your friends may not even know what you're talking about. 

You're curious, you like figuring things out, but most of all you want your work to matter, to mean something. 

You love local media but feel it barely exists anymore. 

You live in the Greater Moncton area and want to make it better, way better, and you know that it is people who'll make that happen. 

Youâ€™re obsessed with your smart phone, tablet, or iPod; you know how to use it or are working like crazy to figure it out.

Note, and it's an important note: There is no pay yet, but the goal is a decent living and more. It's a business you're going to help make for yourself and, like any business, there are no guarantees.

But even if this thing tanks, you'll be a lot smarter.
