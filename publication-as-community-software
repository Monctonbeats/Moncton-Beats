Jonathan Harris, author of Data Driven, an article I read in an app called The Human Face of Big Data, wrote in that article that "..software is the staging ground for the future." He talks about developers' choice of default settings as having potentially massive consequences given the exponential power of the Internet's networking. Think Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

When we think of software we think of MS Word, Adobe Photoshop, Google Chrome plus the millions upon millions of apps that have been created for our smart devices. We think of software as a tool we use (or a toy we play with). We generally think of it as external to us. It could run a device like a pacemaker that keeps us alive, but it is still external as in it is a tool. 

When we think of a publication like a newspaper, magazine or television program, we think of it as something we consume. Some like The New Internationalist try to effect change. NI is run as a co-op and therefor has a democratic centre, but it is still a publication to be consumed. 

What would a community publication have to do or be for it to be thought of as software that is essential to making our community flourish? How would it have to be developed for it to become part of an intelligent fabric connecting everything and making it strong and resilient and making everyone feel like they were part of it?

I almost said Matrix, which is not quite what I had in mind. That would be the dystopian version, people connected but fed a constant illusion to passify them so that their energy can be fed into system that does not consider their wishes.

What if we think of ourselves as part of the software providing not Artificial Intellegence but actual intelligence and that part of the platform is the community.
