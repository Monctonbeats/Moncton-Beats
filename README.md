Moncton Beats starts with individual people. It's an entirely different way of doing journalism and community building. We are out to solve problems, or rather help gather information that can help people solve problems.

It's not just about gathe ing information. It's about developing powerful ways of collaborating to solve problems in pragmatic and innovative ways. Everyone adding their ideas for steady leverage to remove obstacles, build new things, develop programs.
